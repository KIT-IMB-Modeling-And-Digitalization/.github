Numerical Modeling and Digitalization for building materials and concrete structures research group 
====================================================================================================

We are members of working group Numerical Modeling and Digitization of Building Materials and Concrete Structures led by Dr. Ravi Patel (ravi.patel@kit.edu).  Our working group is part of Institute of Building materials and concrete structure ([KIT-IMB/MPA/CMM](https://www.imb.kit.edu/bt/)). 


We work at the interface of computaitonal science, material science and civil engineering to address the pressing challanges faced by building material sector. 


Our research group deals with topic such as microstructure representation  porous building materials, multiscale modeling, advanced multiphysics modeling using  finite elements and description of the building material behavior using artificial intelligence and machine learning as well as the representation of the microstructure of concrete using thermodynamic modeling to predict the durability-relevant properties and mechanical characteristics of concrete.
